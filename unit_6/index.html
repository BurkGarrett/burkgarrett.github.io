        		<h3>Why they chose Betts.</h3>
        		<p>"Betts is a rare breed in the recruiting world. As a Sales Engineer candidate, I was blown away by their exhaustive knowledge of technical sales, passion for recruiting, and assiduousness in helping me land my ideal role. Betts turned every conversation into a mentoring opportunity providing me with the insights I needed to master the interview process. From proactively prepping me for an interview on a Sunday evening to instantaneous feedback from an interviewer, we were in constant communication. I am incredibly grateful for their support and guidance. I would be fortunate to work with Betts again as a candidate!"</p>
